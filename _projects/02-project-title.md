title: Improving rural connectivity through 5G
---

The scope of this problem statement is to find ways to use 5G technology to improve connectivity in rural areas at competitive costs which typically have poor or non-existent internet access. The background of this problem is that while 5G technology has the potential to bring faster and more reliable internet access to remote areas, there are still many challenges to overcome in terms of infrastructure and cost. Do make a list of potential scenarios (farming / plantations / homes / offices / fishing / etc.) you see as important and really addressing the problems including your proposed 5G based connectivity scenarios; What is the end to end solution (what are the building blocks); How cost effective are these solutions and the time and effort to get these implemented.
