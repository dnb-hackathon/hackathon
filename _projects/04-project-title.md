title: Enhancing smart city infrastructure with 5G
---

The scope of this problem statement is to explore how 5G technology can be used 
to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of smart city infrastructure, such as 
traffic management systems, public transportation, and emergency response systems. 
The background of this problem is that as cities become more connected and reliant 
on technology, the need for faster and more robust communication networks becomes 
increasingly important.
