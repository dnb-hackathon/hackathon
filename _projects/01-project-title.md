title: Optimal base station positioning at seaport
---
The shipyard area is where TEU containers are stored, for both imports and exports. Due to the dynamic container load change during loading/unloading, the height of containers can stack from nil to several (eg. 5 containers with each 2.6m). The metallic nature of TEU containers can severely affect RF propagation especially if antenna towers are inland and serving is required at the far end of vessel berth. Investigation/analysis is suggested to determine the optimal base station placement and planning to ensure 5G coverage is available for all use cases.
