title: Evaluate the optimal base station positioning, including antenna panning, to support seaport use cases
---
The shipyard area is where TEU containers are stored, for both imports and exports. Due to the dynamic container load change during loading/unloading, the height of containers can stack from nil to several (eg. 5). The metallic nature of TEU containers can severely affect RF propagation especially if towers are inland and serving is required at the far end of vessel berth. Investigation/analysis is suggested to determine the optimal antenna placement and panning to ensure 5G services are unaffected for all use cases.
